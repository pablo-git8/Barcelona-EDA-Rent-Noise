# Barcelona Rent and Noise Analysis

## Project Overview
This project conducts a thorough exploratory data analysis of the interconnection between rental prices and noise levels across different neighborhoods in Barcelona. Leveraging a combination of datasets from CSV files and the Ajuntament de Barcelona Open Data Portal, we visualize patterns, perform principal component analysis, and derive insights into the urban landscape's influence on living expenses.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For all data ingestion, processing, and exploratory data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Employed for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Utilized for creating insightful visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Specifically, PCA for dimensionality reduction and StandardScaler for feature standardization.

## Data Sources
- **CSV Files**: Structured data files for initial dataset.
- **[Open Data Portal (Ajuntament de Barcelona)](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/es/dataset)**: API endpoints providing real-time access to urban data.

## Setup and Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can then install the required libraries using:


pip install `pandas` `matplotlib` `seaborn` `scikit-learn` `requests`


## Usage
To run the analysis, simply open the main Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository.

## Acknowledgements
Special thanks to Ajuntament de Barcelona for making their data publicly accessible and facilitating this research.
